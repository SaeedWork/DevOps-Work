My idea was inspired by the need for isolated development environments. I wanted to simulate how a backend service and database communicate in production.

One creative aspect was adding a self-healing monitoring script to detect and restart an unhealthy MongoDB service. This demonstrates how Docker enables automated recovery.

The biggest challenge was managing inter-service communication manually without Docker Compose. I solved it using a custom Docker network and explicit container names.

Dockerâ€™s features, especially multi-stage builds, networking, and volumes, made this project cleaner and more modular. I could test services independently and integrate later.

In production, I would add NGINX as a reverse proxy, implement CI/CD pipelines, secure environment variables, and scale the app using Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
